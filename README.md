# The Final year project details are listed below:
FYP=>Simulating real time route planning for rapid bus transit:

Using Contraction hierarchies (Dijkstra) this algorithm reduces the size of graph in pre-processing 
Maps are imported using OSM(open street maps)
Netedit(used to modify graphs edges and nodes)
Sumo used to display simulation
