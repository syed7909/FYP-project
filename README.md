Proect Title: Simulating real time route planning for rapid bus transit.

Algortihtm Used:
        Contraction hierarchies =>Dijkstra this algorithm as it gives best time and space complexity values in our scenario.
Softwares Used:
        Maps are imported using OSM(open street maps)
        Netedit(used to modify graph's edges and nodes)
        Sumo used to display simulation
