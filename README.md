# The Final year project details are listed below:
FYP=>Simulating real time route planning for rapid bus transit:

Using Contraction hierarchies (Dijkstra) this algorithm reduces the size of graph in pre-processing 
Maps are imported using OSM(open street maps)
Netedit(used to modify graph's edges and nodes)
Sumo used to display simulation 

The XML files are attached with routes defined along the axis and locations with all parameters set you can refer to the documentation of the project for a deep understanding of the project
